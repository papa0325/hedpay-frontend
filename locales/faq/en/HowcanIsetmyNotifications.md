Go to Menu: Personal > Preferences > Notifications
Notifications can be generated in HEdpAY when a status is changed, or an activity has been performed. For example: a received payment, balance change, credit limit change, received reference etc. The notifications can be sent as e-mail and in the future other channels will be added (SMS, USSD).
